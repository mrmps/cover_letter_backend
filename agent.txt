1. take the original query and create a complex goal from it (ask gpt to create a very full description of the goal, with any details that might be relevant)
2. take the new goal, and then from that goal, think of what information is needed, in the form of a list, be as descriptive as possible
3. return a json of information to google search query that is likely to get that information and what we are trying to find in question format:
Example: 
{
    "information": "information we are trying to get, e.g. top 10 polo brands based in SF",
    "question": "question that asks what we are trying to find"
    "serp_query": "serp query for that question"
}
3.5. make the serp queries
4. for each result, return a summary of all the information relevant to the subquery
5. combine the summaries into one blob
6. answer the original question based on that blob
7 (optional). Based on this answer and the new goal, think of what information is still needed, and repeat steps 3-6 (needs some kind of recursive depth. Good start is 2)
